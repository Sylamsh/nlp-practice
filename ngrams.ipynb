        "train_lyrics=\"\"\"Brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) measure brain activity, extract features from that activity, and convert those features into outputs that replace, restore, enhance, supplement, or improve human functions.\n",
        "BCIs may replace lost functions, such as speaking or moving. They may restore the ability to control the body, such as by stimulating nerves or muscles that move the hand. BCIs have also been used to improve functions, such as training users to improve the remaining function of damaged pathways required to grasp. BCIs can also enhance function, like warning a sleepy driver to wake up. Finally, a BCI might supplement the body’s natural outputs, such as through a third hand.\n",
        "Different techniques are used to measure brain activity for BCIs. Most BCIs have used electrical signals that are detected using electrodes placed invasively within or on the surface of the cortex, or noninvasively on the surface of the scalp [electroencephalography (EEG)]. Some BCIs have been based on metabolic activity that is measured noninvasively, such as through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).\n",
        "This chapter is focused on providing an overview of noninvasive BCIs. After a brief review of the relevant aspects of EEG and fMRI, each of the subsequent sections is dedicated to one of the four different purposes that a BCI may serve and that have been realized as of this writing.\n",
